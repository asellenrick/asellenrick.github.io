# Saving layers dynamically out of photoshop.
---

## Doesn't photoshop already do this?

Yes, but it wasn't good enough. There are ways in photoshop to save all layers as an image, or you might be able to write an action to do some of what you are looking for... but I needed **more**.

## What exactly was I trying to do?
I had a client that had *thousands* of product image. The images needed to be organized and saved based on department, collections, colors, etc. If I was going to organizing my photoshop file to reflect this structure, I did not want to do that twice.

## Photoshop scripts to the rescue!

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
